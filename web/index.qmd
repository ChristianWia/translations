# Getting started

Welcome to the translation adventure in R! 🚀

In a world that thrives on interconnectedness and global communication, translation plays a pivotal role in bridging
linguistic divides. Translation, the art of rendering one language into another, shatters those confines, unlocking a
world of possibilities for understanding and collaboration.

[Translation dashboards](https://contributor.r-project.org/translations-dashboard/)

So if you want to start, you can contribute by following these steps:

1. Sign up to the [R Contributors Slack](https://contributor.r-project.org/slack) and introduce yourself in the
#core-translations channel;

1. Create an account on [Weblate](https://translate.rx.studio/) and read the Translations chapter on the [R Development
guide](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/);

1. Read the [Conventions for translation](Conventions_for_Languages/index.qmd)
section of this Wiki, for some conventions that should be followed;

1. Read the guidelines for the specific language you want to contribute to. If a guideline for your language doesn't
exist yet, please feel free to submit a pull request and create it.

1. You can start translating!

You can check the
[guide](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/chapters/message_translations.html#how-to-contribute-new-translations) on how
Weblate works and check this short [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFwTn32MrBw) on how to use the Weblate
interface. You can also get access to complete documentation of Weblate through this
[link](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/).

### What is being translated?

All outputs in base R and recommended packages (such as messages emitted by `stop()`,
`warning()`, or `message()`) are eligible for translation, as are menu labels in the GUI.

## Roles

Languages without an established translation team and so without dedicated reviewers have their translations directly approved without review.
In that perspective, there's a single role for translators, and no reviewers.

In case a team has been established for a language, we use the [dedicated reviewers](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/workflows.html#dedicated-reviewers)
workflow on Weblate, where we currently manage 3 roles in the platform.

### Translators

Every registered user on Weblate can act as a translator for any language. All translations need to be reviewed unless there is
no reviewer assigned for that language. If you are not sure about a translation, you can make a suggestion instead. You
can also use the Glossary to check which terms you shouldn't translate and discuss with the community to add new ones if
you don't find the word you are looking for.

### Reviewers

Reviewers bear the editor role to approve the work of translators and ensure the overall cohesion of the
translation work in one language. For adding new reviewers for a language, please reach out to the
respective team leaders via the `#core-translation` channel on the [R Contributors
Slack](https://contributor.r-project.org/slack) workspace.

### Team leaders

Team administrators and leaders keep the list of admins and reviewers for a language up to date. The team
leader(s) of a particular language is(are) the initial [dedicated
reviewer(s)](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/workflows.html#dedicated-reviewers) as well.

## How to start a new language team

To request the creation of a new language team, please reach out on the `core-translation` channel of the [R Contributors Slack](https://contributor.r-project.org/slack) workspace, and the [administrators of Weblate](https://contributor.r-project.org/translations/Weblate-server.html#administrators) will follow the steps described in the [Weblate server admin page](https://contributor.r-project.org/translations/Weblate-server.html#team-leaders).

In short, a new team will be created for the language with roles to approve translations and edit the language-specific glossary, then you (and others listed as team leaders) will be added to that team so that the dedicated reviewers workflow becomes enforced for that language.

Additionally, language team administrators can be also shortlisted among the reviewers with permissions to add new reviewers to the team, and to manage the team members.

## Translation states

Possible state of a string:

* **Untranslated**: Translation is missing, and might or might not be stored in the translation file.
* **Needs editing**: Translation needs editing. This is usually the result of a source string
change, fuzzy matching or translator action. The `fuzzy` tag might be commited to the translation file. **If you are unsure about how to translate something, make a suggestion instead of clicking the "Needs editing" button**.
* **Waiting for review**: Translation is made, but not reviewed yet.
* **Approved**: Translation has been approved in the review. It can no longer be changed by translators, but only by reviewers. This is also committed to the repository.

## Sustainability of the translations community

- The `#core-translation` channel on the [R Contributors Slack](https://contributor.r-project.org/slack) workspace is
the main space of communication for the translations  community. Join this Slack to communicate with the community and
share feedback.
- We encourage people interested in translations to organize and conduct local/regional level events to promote and
raise awareness about translations.
- Highlight milestones (overall and by language)!
