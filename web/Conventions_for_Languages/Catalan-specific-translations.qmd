## About

The goal of the Catalan Team is to bring together all people interested in helping translate the [R 
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) into Catalan. If you use R a lot, we 
need your help!

Unlike other languages, R tries to display every message in the same language as the computer it's running on. In 
principle, this reduces R's barrier to entry; warnings and errors are very common in code written by beginners, so it's 
essential that these messages are as clear as possible.

## How to contribute

To help in the translation process, you need to:

1. Sign up to the [R Contributors Slack](https://contributor.r-project.org/slack) and introduce yourself in the 
`#core-translations` channel;
2. Join [#core-translation-ca](https://app.slack.com/client/T01DW9DLB2A/C061B671J8G) channel. 
3. Read the [Resources](#resources) section of this document, because the translation has some conventions that should 
be followed;
4. Create an account on [Weblate](https://translate.rx.studio/) (currently maintained by 
[@daroczig](https://twitter.com/daroczig));
5. List every Catalan [component](https://translate.rx.studio/languages/ca/r-project/);
6. Choose a component that's not 100% translated;
7. Click **Unfinished strings** to list all messages that haven't been translated and
8. Start!

## Resources

### Style

The Catalan project sticks to the [Guia d'estil de Softcatalà](https://www.softcatala.org/guia-estil-de-softcatala/).
Have a look and check it when in doubts. There is a 
[cheat sheet](https://github.com/Softcatala/resum-guiaestil/blob/master/guia.pdf) with a resume.

### Terminology

There are different sources for Catalan terminology

- [Glossari de Softcatalà](https://static.softcatala.org/terminology/tots-glossary.html)
- [Termcat](https://www.termcat.cat), el centre de terminologia de la llengua catalana

### Translation memories

In case of doubts, an useful resource is the compilation of [translation 
memories](https://www.softcatala.org/recursos/memories/) for Catalan. Check how other projects translate
similar concepts and get inspired.

### Automatic translations

Softcatalà provides [automatic translations](https://www.softcatala.org/traductor/) for `.po` files. Despite the results
are quite good, it's necessary to review carefully each string. You can download the `.po` files from Weblate website:

Alternatively, you can:

1. Clone the repository using your [private URL](https://translate.rx.studio/accounts/profile/#api) with:

``` bash
git clone https://$USER:$PRIVATE_TOKEN@translate.rx.studio/git/r-project/base-r-gui/
```

2. Look for the files at `src/library/*/po/*ca.po` and use any app to help you to review and fix the translations (eg. 
[Poedit](https://poedit.net/) or [Lokalize](https://apps.kde.org/ca/lokalize/))

3. You can not push to this repository. To upload the finished files, use the Weblate web interface (see image above).

### R-project specific conventions

* We use Latin quotes ([cometes baixes](https://www.softcatala.org/guia-estil-de-softcatala/aspectes-convencionals/)) as
a «primary quotes» for cases that are not part of R code. Insert them with `AltGr + z` («) and `AltGr + x` (»).

### Glossary

Weblate has a built-in [glossary](https://translate.rx.studio/browse/r-project/glossary/ca/) that will be shown while
doing a translation in Weblate with a matching term. To add new terms, better to discuss it with the community first
and reach a consensus.

### Quality report

Softcatalà generates quality reports periodically on R translations using LanguageTool and Pology. Check it out at
<https://static.softcatala.org/quality/r-project.html>.
