# Getting starter 

Welcolme to the traslation adventure in R!

In a world that thrives on interconnectedness and global communication, translation plays a pivotal role in bridging linguistic divides. Translation, the art of rendering one language into another, shatters those confines, unlocking a world of possibilities for understanding and collaboration.

So if you want start, you can contribute following those steps:

1. Sign up to the [R Contributors Slack](https://contributor.r-project.org/slack) and introduce yourself in the #core-translations channel;
2. Read the [Resources](https://github.com/r-devel/translations/wiki/) section of this document, because the translation has some conventions that should be followed;
3. Create an account on [Weblate](https://translate.rx.studio/) (currently maintained by [@daroczig](https://twitter.com/daroczig));
4. List the [components](https://translate.rx.studio/languages/) of your language;
5. Choose a component that's not 100% translated (like, for example, the [utils package](https://translate.rx.studio/languages/es/r-project/));
6. Click Unfinished strings to list all messages that haven't been translated and
7. Start!

This is a short [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFwTn32MrBw) that you can check for use the interface of Weblate.

You can access to full documentation of Weblate throght this [link](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/).

Some translation states are important:
* **Untranslated**: Translation is empty, it might or not be stored in the file, depending on the file format.
* **Needs editing**: Translation needs editing, this is usually the result of a source string change, fuzzy matching or translator action.
* **Waiting for review**: Translation is made, but not reviewed.
* **Approved**: Translation has been approved in the review. It can no longer be changed by translators, but only by reviewers.

Exist some key points when you starting traslation:

1. Every registered user on the Weblate can act as a translator.
2. The translation that you participate, should be reviewing.
3. A [peer reviewer](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/workflows.html#peer-review) can add suggestion(s) to the Weblate, however, the suggestion(s) would need approval from the dedicated reviewer(s) before it is accepted as a translation.
4. Adding the missing worlds in the Glosary.

Finally, those are the guidelines for the existing languages:
