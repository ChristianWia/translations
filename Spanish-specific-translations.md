_This repository is a hub for all people who want to help translate R into
Spanish. This README is in English, but you can reach out to
other translators on the R Contributors Slack if you need any additional
information about the project._

## About
The goal of the _es_ project is to bring together all people interested in
helping translate the [R
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) into Spanish. If you use R a lot, we need your help!

Unlike other languages, R tries to display every message in the same language as
the computer it's running on. In principle, this reduces R's barrier to entry;
warnings and errors are very common in code written by beginners, so it's
essential that these messages are as clear as possible.

Many other countries already have consolidated translation
[teams](https://developer.r-project.org/TranslationTeams.html), but (maybe
because of the complexity of the
[job](https://developer.r-project.org/Translations30.html)) Brazil lacked any
official collaborators. Nowadays, however, it's easier than ever to help with
translations and that's why we wanted to collect our efforts on this page.

To help in the translation process, you need to:

1. Sign up to the [R Contributors
   Slack](https://contributor.r-project.org/slack) and introduce yourself in the
   `#core-translations` channel;
1. Read the [Resources](https://github.com/r-devel/translations/wiki/Spanish-specific-translations#resources) section of
   this document, because the translation has some conventions that should be
   followed;
1. Create an account on [Weblate](https://translate.rx.studio/) (currently
   maintained by [@daroczig](https://twitter.com/daroczig));
1. List every Spanish
   [component](https://translate.rx.studio/languages/pt_BR/r-project/);
1. Choose a component that's not 100% translated (like, for example, the [utils
   package](https://translate.rx.studio/languages/es/r-project/));
1. Click **Unfinished strings** to list all messages that haven't been
   translated and
1. Start!
