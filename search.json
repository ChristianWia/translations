    "text": "Welcome to the translation adventure in R! üöÄ\nIn a world that thrives on interconnectedness and global communication, translation plays a pivotal role in bridging linguistic divides. Translation, the art of rendering one language into another, shatters those confines, unlocking a world of possibilities for understanding and collaboration.\nTranslation dashboards\nSo if you want to start, you can contribute by following these steps:\n\nSign up to the R Contributors Slack and introduce yourself in the #core-translations channel;\nCreate an account on Weblate (currently maintained by @daroczig) and read the Translations chapter on the R Development guide;\nRead the Conventions for translation section of this Wiki, for some conventions that should be followed;\nRead the guidelines for the specific language you want to contribute to. If a guideline for your language doesn‚Äôt exist yet, please feel free to submit a pull request and create it.\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\n\n\n\nArabic\n\n\nBengali\n\n\nCatalan\n\n\nChinese\n\n\nHindi\n\n\nNepali\n\n\nPortuguese (Brazilian)\n\n\nSpanish\n\n\n\n\nYou can start translating!\n\nYou can check the guide on how Weblate works and check this short demo on how to use the Weblate interface. You can also get access to complete documentation of Weblate through this link.\n\n\nAll outputs in base R and recommended packages (such as messages emitted by stop(), warning(), or message()) are eligible for translation, as are menu labels in the GUI.\n\n\n\nWe use the dedicated reviewers workflow on Weblate. We currently manage 3 roles in the platform. Languages without dedicated reviewers have their translations directly approved without review.\n\n\nEvery registered user on Weblate can act as a translator. All translations are reviewed unless there is no reviewer assigned for that language. If you are not sure about a translation you can make a suggestion instead. You can also use the Glossary to check which terms you shouldn‚Äôt translate and discuss with the community to add new ones if you don‚Äôt find the word you are looking for.\n\n\n\nAdmins/team leaders keep the list of admins and reviewers by language up to date. The team leader(s) of a particular language is(are) the initial dedicated reviewer(s).\n\n\n\nReviewers have an editor role who approves the work of translators and ensures the overall cohesion of the translation work in one language.

    "text": "Why Weblate?\nPlease see the problem statement and proposed solution in the R Project Sprint 2023‚Äôs Weblate project.\n\n\nWhat is a ‚Äúcomponent‚Äù?\nEach R package has been implemented as at least one component in Weblate, referring to the strings to be translated in a PO file.\nWhen a package includes multiple PO files (e.g.¬†one for the strings extracted from the C sources, another one for the strings extracted from the R sources, and another one for the GUI strings), then there are multiple components for a package.\n\n\nHow to add a new language for a component?\nAfter logging in and selecting a component, you should see a ‚ÄúStart new translation‚Äù button at the bottom of the page, see e.g.¬†at https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/base-c/\n\n\nHow to add a new component?\nOnly Weblate admins can do that. For now, please reach out to @daroczig or @MichaelChirico.\n\nGo the the R Project project dashboard\nClick on the ‚ÄúAdd new translation component‚Äù button at the bottom of the page 3. Provide a name for the component following the naming schema of the other components (package name optionally followed by R or C files between parens, e.g.¬†methods (R files)). It is required to split a package into (at least) two components when there are multiple PO files around, e.g.¬†for R and C files, sometime even a 3rd one for the GUI\nSource code repo should point to weblate://r-project/base-r-gui (this is set to auto-poll the SVN repo)\nFile format is usually gettext PO file (for strings extracted from R core and recommended packages), or e.g.¬†iOS strings (for Mac GUI) 6. Provide file mask, e.g.¬†src/library/base/po/*.po or src/library/compiler/po/R-*.po\nSet a Language filter when needed to guide Weblate which files to pick up (e.g.¬†to exclude the PO files starting with R (part of the ‚ÄúR files‚Äù component) for the ‚ÄúC files‚Äù component, something like ^(?!en$)[a-z][^.]+$\n\n\n\nHow to add a new package?\nSee above for the definition of a ‚Äúcomponent‚Äù, and based on that, see the section on ‚ÄúHow to add a new component?‚Äù.\n\n\nWhat packages are translated in Weblate?\nCurrently, only base R packages. There are plans to support recommended packages as well. Other R packages can also use this installation of Weblate, as per below:\n\n\nHow to add a package I maintain to Weblate?\nIf you maintain an R package using gettext (or similar) in a public git or SVN repo, and you are planning to use this installation of Weblate to crowdsource the translation of your already extracted strings, please reach out to the Weblate admins to discuss the details, but in short, the following steps are expected:\n\nThe Weblate admins create a new component using your git/SVN repo\nOptionally set up push-back hooks to the master or other branch, so that new translations are available in the original repo as well\n\n\n\nHow to test the changes I made in Weblate?\nSpeaking about translations done in a base R package, you will need to build R. Instead of the official SVN repo, you could use Weblate‚Äôs git repo at https://translate.rx.studio/git/r-project/base-r-gui/, which includes all new translations up to the past few minutes (translations are committed to the git repo every few minutes). In case you don‚Äôt want to clone the Weblate git repo, you can download the PO files from Weblate by visiting a component and downloading either all PO files as a ZIP file or selecting a language you can download an individual PO file.\n\n\nHow to manage translation teams in Weblate?\nEach language team has leaders and reviewers. Only language team leaders and the Weblate admins can remove existing users from the teams, and can add new team members. Team leaders can find their language team listed on their profile, where they can edit the list of users in the group.\nNew languages will not have teams; by default any translator can add new messages without a review process. The review process is recommended to encourage consistency across the body of translations. If you want to start a team for a new language, contact the Weblate admins.\n\n\nHow to get notifications about language updates?\nGo to the Notification settings on our profile, select which projects (e.g.¬†base R and/or recommended R packages) you want to monitor, and select the types of ‚ÄúTranslation notifications‚Äù you are interested in (e.g.¬†‚ÄúPending suggestions‚Äù for reviewers)."

We should always follow Portuguese‚Äôs grammar and orthography, including the new Spelling Reform, but we also want to preserve the original language as much as possible.\nIn English it is possible to omit many connectors without changing the meaning. The Italian and French teams usually restore these connectors when the alternative wouldn‚Äôt sound as natural.\n\nMaybe package installed with version of R newer than %s ?\n\n\nTalvez o pacote tenha sido instalado com uma vers√£o do R mais recente que %s ?\n\nWe also don‚Äôt translate anything that is a technical term from R like, for example, function names, objects and arguments (usually between quotes).\n\n‚ÄòMARGIN‚Äô does not match dim(X)\n\n\n‚ÄòMARGIN‚Äô n√£o corresponde a dim(X)\n\nIn exceptional situations, a function can be used as a verb. Following the French and Italian teams, the only solution is to completely reconstruct the sentence.\n\ncannot xtfrm data frames\n\n\nimposs√≠vel utilizar xtfrm em um data frame\n\n\nFormatting\nThe use of spaces and paragraphs in Portuguese is standardised and well established. R texts, however, have space and formatting limitations that are not always obvious when translating.\nMost R messages have some kind of reference to the code that generated them. This happens through format specifiers and we need to keep them in the same order as they appear in the reference text.\n\n%s and %s must have the same length\n\n\n%s e %s devem ter o mesmo comprimento\n\nIf it‚Äôs not possible to keep the same order, you need to specify the index of the desired substitution with %n$&lt;fmt&gt; (e.g.¬†%1$s, %2$s, and so on).\nMessages can also have special characters such as single quotes ('), double quotes (\"), tabs (\\t) and new lines (\\n), as well as extra spaces in strange places. To maintain a standard, we don‚Äôt change this type of formatting even if its use is not strictly correct.\n\nConflicts attaching package %s:%s\n\n\nConflitos ao anexar pacote %s:%s\n\n\n\nGender\nUnlike Portuguese, English does not specify grammatical gender.

The same word can also have several functions, such as ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù, which simultaneously means ‚Äúsubstituto‚Äù and ‚Äúsubstitui√ß√£o‚Äù.\nFinally, we have chosen to keep some of the terms in English, as their translations are not widely used, but this perception is purely subjective; the words marked with an asterisk * are those that we ourselves are questioning.\n\n\n\nIngl√™s\nPortugu√™s\n\n\n\n\nabort\ninterromper\n\n\nalias\nalias*\n\n\nallocate\nalocar\n\n\nargument\nargumento\n\n\narray\narray\n\n\nassign\natribuir\n\n\nattach\nanexar\n\n\nattribute\natributo\n\n\nbackslash\nbarra invertida\n\n\nbind\nassociar / vincular\n\n\nbitmap\nbitmap\n\n\nboxplot\nboxplot\n\n\nbreak\nlimite de categoria (para histogramas)\n\n\nbrowser\nnavegador\n\n\nbuild\ncompilar\n\n\nbytecode\nbytecode\n\n\ncache\ncachear\n\n\ncall\nchamar\n\n\ncallback\ncallback\n\n\ncharacter string\nstring de caracteres*\n\n\ncheck\nverificar\n\n\nchunk\nbloco (de c√≥digo)*\n\n\nclosure\nclosure\n\n\ncodoc\ncodoc (da fun√ß√£o do R)\n\n\ncoerce\nfazer coer√ß√£o\n\n\ncolortype\ncolortype\n\n\nconsole\nconsole\n\n\ndata frame\ndata frame\n\n\ndatabase\nbase de dados\n\n\ndataset\nconjunto de dados\n\n\ndebug\ndepurar*\n\n\ndefunct\nextinto\n\n\ndeparse\ndeparse\n\n\ndeprecated\nobsoleto\n\n\ndetach\ndetach*\n\n\ndevice\ndispositivo\n\n\ndispatch\ndespachar\n\n\ndocumentation object\nobjeto de documenta√ß√£o*\n\n\ndownload\nbaixar\n\n\ndriver\ndriver\n\n\ndrop\ndescartar\n\n\nencoding\ncodifica√ß√£o\n\n\nentry\nregistro / campo\n\n\nenvironment\nambiente\n\n\nevaluate\navaliar (por exemplo, eval())*\n\n\nfactor\nfator\n\n\nfifo\nfifo (de first in, first out)\n\n\nfile pointer\nponteiro de arquivo*\n\n\nfile stream\nstream de arquivo\n\n\nfilename\nnome do arquivo\n\n\nfit\najustar\n\n\nflag\nflag\n\n\nflush\nesvaziar\n\n\nframe\nquadro (para stack) / escopo (para call)\n\n\nhandle\ngerenciar\n\n\nhard-coded\nhard-coded*\n\n\nhistory\nhist√≥rico\n\n\nimplement\nimplementar\n\n\nincoming checks\nverifica√ß√µes de recebimento*\n\n\nindex\n√≠ndice\n\n\ninvalid\ninv√°lido\n\n\nIO\nIO\n\n\nlabel\nr√≥tulo\n\n\nlag\ndefasagem\n\n\nlayout\nlayout*\n\n\nlazy loading\nlazy loading*\n\n\nlazydata\nlazydata\n\n\nleading minor\nsubmatriz*\n\n\nlength\ncomprimento\n\n\nlibrary\nbiblioteca\n\n\nlink\nlink\n\n\nlocale\nlocale\n\n\nlocator\nlocalizador\n\n\nlocking\ntravamento*\n\n\nlogical\nl√≥gico (ao inv√©s de booleano)\n\n\nmacro\nmacro\n\n\nmagic number\nn√∫mero m√°gico\n\n\nmatch\ncorresponder\n\n\nmetafile\nmetafile\n\n\nmirror\nespelho (por exemplo, do CRAN)\n\n\nmismatch\nincompat√≠vel\n\n\nmissing\nausente\n\n\nmodulus\nm√≥dulo\n\n\nmultibyte\nmultibyte\n\n\nnamespace\nnamespace*\n\n\nnon-interactively\nde forma n√£o interativa\n\n\nnon-numeric type\ntipo n√£o num√©rico\n\n\nnumeric-alike\nnum√©rico ou similar*\n\n\noffending\nproblem√°tico\n\n\noffset\ndeslocar / compensar (depende do contexto)\n\n\nopcode\nopcode\n\n\noutlier\noutlier*\n\n\noverflow\noverflow\n\n\noverride\nsobrescrever\n\n\npackage\npacote\n\n\npager\nvisualizador*\n\n\npair list\nlista pareada\n\n\nparse\nanalisar*\n\n\npath\ncaminho\n\n\npipe\npipe\n\n\npixmap\npixmap\n\n\nplatform\nplataforma\n\n\npolyline\npolyline\n\n\nport\nporta (por exemplo, 8080)\n\n\nportable\nport√°vel\n\n\nprofiling\nan√°lise de desempenho\n\n\nprofile\nperfil (substantivo), perfilar (verbo)\n\n\npromise\npromessa\n\n\nprompt\nprompt\n\n\nproxy\nproxy\n\n\npush back\nvoltar atr√°s\n\n\nquote symbol\ns√≠mbolo de cita√ß√£o\n\n\nrange\nintervalo / limite (depende do contexto)\n\n\nraw\nraw (para o tipo de dado)\n\n\nredraw\nredesenhar\n\n\nregular expression\nexpress√£o regular\n\n\nreplace\nsubstituir\n\n\nreport\nreportar\n\n\nrepository\nreposit√≥rio\n\n\nrequire\nrequerer*\n\n\nreturn\nretornar\n\n\nRNG\nRNG\n\n\nrole\npapel*\n\n\nroutine\nrotina\n\n\nrun\nexecutar\n\n\nseal\nselar\n\n\nsearch path\ncaminho de busca\n\n\nseed\nsemente\n\n\nseek\nbuscar\n\n\nsink\nsink\n\n\nslash\nbarra\n\n\nslot\nslot (termo do R)*\n\n\nsnapshot\nsnapshot\n\n\nsocket\nsoquete\n\n\nsource\ncarregar\n\n\nsplice\njuntar\n\n\nstack\nstack*\n\n\nstandardizable\npadroniz√°vel\n\n\nstartup\ninicializa√ß√£o\n\n\nstrict\nrigoroso(a)\n\n\nsubscript\n√≠ndice*\n\n\nsubset\ndividir em subconjuntos\n\n\ntag\netiqueta\n\n\ntag\ntag*\n\n\ntangling\ntangling*\n\n\ntarball\ntarball\n\n\ntemplate\nmodelo*\n\n\nthread\nthread*\n\n\ntimeout\nlimite de tempo\n\n\ntimer\ncron√¥metro\n\n\ntimezone\nfuso hor√°rio\n\n\ntop level\nn√≠vel superior\n\n\ntraceback\ntraceback\n\n\ntruncate\ntruncar\n\n\nunary operator\noperador un√°rio\n\n\nunbind\ndesvincular\n\n\nunderflow\nunderflow\n\n\nunlisted\nn√£o listado\n\n\nviewport\nviewport\n\n\nvignette\nvignette\n\n\nwarning\nalerta\n\n\nworkspace\nambiente de trabalho\n\n\nwrapup\nfinaliza√ß√£o*"

If you use R a lot, we need your help!\nUnlike other languages, R tries to display every message in the same language as the computer it‚Äôs running on. In principle, this reduces R‚Äôs barrier to entry; warnings and errors are very common in code written by beginners, so it‚Äôs essential that these messages are as clear as possible."

    "text": "About\nThe goal of the np project is to bring together all people interested in helping translate the R language into Nepali. If you use R a lot, we need your help!\nUnlike other languages, R tries to display every message in the same language as the computer it‚Äôs running on. In principle, this reduces R‚Äôs barrier to entry; warnings and errors are very common in code written by beginners, so it‚Äôs essential that these messages are as clear as possible."

    "text": "Rules:\nTranslating R programming messages and warnings from English to Nepali requires careful attention to both the technical accuracy and linguistic clarity of the translated text. Here‚Äôs a translation guide to help you with this process:\n\nUnderstand the Context:\n\nBefore translating any message or warning, it‚Äôs crucial to understand the context. Know what the message is conveying, what part of the code it relates to, and its intended audience.\n\nMaintain Technical Accuracy:\n\nEnsure that the translated message conveys the same technical information as the original. The goal is to make sure that users can still understand the issue or information provided.\n\nPreserve Clarity:\n\nClarity is paramount in translations. Make sure the translated message is clear and easy to understand. Avoid overly complex or verbose translations.\n\nUse Formal Nepali:\n\nWhen translating messages for a general audience or professional context. Avoid using dialects unless the message is for a specific region where a particular dialect is preferred.\n\nConsistency:\n\nMaintain consistency in your translations. Use consistent terminology and wording throughout the translation to avoid confusion.\n\nBe Mindful of Length:\n\nConsider that the Nepali translation might be longer or shorter than the English text. Ensure that the translated message fits within the space allocated in the code or interface.\n\nRetain Technical Terms:\n\nFor technical terms and code-related elements such as function names, object names, and variable names, it‚Äôs often best to keep them in English. Use the Nepali script for these terms if necessary but maintain the English terminology.\n\nHandle Plurals:\n\nNepali nouns have different forms for singular and plural. Ensure that you correctly handle plurals when translating messages that involve counts or quantities.\n\nPunctuation:\n\nUse punctuation stop (|) and ensure proper spacing around punctuation marks.\n\nSpecial Characters:\n\nSome technical messages may contain special characters like %s, %d, or %f for string, integer, and floating-point substitutions. Keep these special characters and their order in the translated message, making sure they correspond correctly with the placeholders.\n\nTest the Translation:\n\nAfter translating, test the messages in the R environment to ensure they appear correctly and are still functional.\n\nDocument Translations:\n\nKeep a record of your translations for reference. This documentation can help maintain consistency in future translations and facilitate collaboration with other translators.\n\nSeek Feedback:\n\nIf possible, seek feedback from native Nepali speakers who are also familiar with programming to ensure the translations make sense in the intended context.\n\nRevise and Update:\n\nProgramming languages evolve, and so should your translations. Periodically review and update your translations to align with changes in the R programming language or best practices in translation.\nRemember that translating programming messages is a specialized skill that requires a strong understanding of both the source and target languages as well as the technical context. Collaborating with other experienced translators can also improve the quality of your translations."
